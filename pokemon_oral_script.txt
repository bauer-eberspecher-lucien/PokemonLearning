SLIDE 1: TITLE PAGE (10 seconds)
Hello everyone. Today I’m going to present my work on exploring Pokémon data using unsupervised learning techniques.
================================================================================
SLIDE 2: OVERVIEW (45 seconds)
The objective of this project was to discover hidden patterns in Pokémon data.
I worked with three datasets:
A dataset of one thousand Pokémon with their statistics such as HP, attack, and defense
A dataset of nine hundred moves with their textual descriptions
And a dataset that links Pokémon to the moves they can learn
The main question was: do Pokémon naturally group themselves according to their characteristics? And if so, do these groups correspond to the official types in the game?
================================================================================
SLIDE 3: UNDERSTANDING THE DATA (30 seconds)
Briefly on the exploratory data analysis part.
I identified missing values that were actually semantically normal. For example, some Pokémon have only one type, so type_2 is empty. Status moves have no power, so the power field is empty. I handled these values appropriately.
An important observation: the data is imbalanced. Water, Normal, and Grass types are overrepresented, which probably reflects the design choices of the developers.
================================================================================
SLIDE 4: CLUSTERING – METHODOLOGY (40 seconds)
For clustering, I made several methodological choices.
I used StandardScaler to normalize the data, because the stats have comparable scales and the distributions are relatively normal.
I chose K-Means as the clustering algorithm because Pokémon have well-defined stat profiles – attackers, defenders, and so on.
To determine the number of clusters, I used the elbow method and the silhouette score. I chose k equal to five, which represents a good compromise between score and interpretability. The silhouette score is around 0.35 to 0.40, which is reasonable for real-world data.
For visualization, I used PCA, which explains about 60% of the variance with two components.
================================================================================
SLIDE 5: THE 5 ARCHETYPES (50 seconds)
So here is the result of the clustering in PCA space.
I identified five distinct archetypes:
One: Fast Sweepers – Pokémon with high attack and high speed
Two: Defensive Walls – with high physical and special defenses
Three: Special Attackers – specialized in special attack
Four: Bulky Pokémon – with a lot of HP
Five: Balanced – with well-balanced stats
What’s interesting is that you can visually see that the clusters are fairly well separated in PCA space, even though we only keep two dimensions.





================================================================================
SLIDE 6: MAIN INSIGHT (1 minute)
And now, the most important discovery of this analysis.
The clusters DO NOT correspond to the official types!
Look at this heatmap of average stats by cluster. You can clearly see the different profiles.
But what does that mean?
In fact, the official types – Fire, Water, Grass – define elemental resistances. Fire beats Grass, Water beats Fire, and so on. It’s the rock-paper-scissors system of the game.
But the clusters I found define combat ROLES. How the Pokémon plays.
A concrete example: a Water-type Pokémon can belong to any cluster depending on its stats. If it has high attack and high speed, it will be a Fast Sweeper. If it has high defense, it will be a Defensive Wall.
The type defines “what it is strong against,” but the cluster defines “how it plays.”
This is a fundamental distinction between elemental mechanics and combat strategy.
================================================================================
SLIDE 7: TEXT ANALYSIS (40 seconds)
For the third part, I analyzed the textual descriptions of moves using TF-IDF.
The analysis reveals very different characteristic words depending on the category:
Physical moves: “damage,” “power,” “attack,” “contact”
Special moves: “user,” “special,” “stat”
Status moves: “target,” “stage,” “effect,” “lowers,” “raises”
But more interestingly, I found subcategories that go beyond the official categories. For example, clusters of healing moves, status effect moves, defensive moves, and stat modification moves.
The text captures the MECHANIC of the move, not just its damage category.
================================================================================
SLIDE 8: STATS VS MOVES (35 seconds)
In the fourth part, I tried to see whether Pokémon that are similar in stats are also similar in moves.
I created a representation based on the moves each Pokémon can learn, and then compared similarities.
Result: there is a moderate correlation. This means that stats and moves capture COMPLEMENTARY aspects.
Stats define the Pokémon’s POTENTIAL – does it hit hard, can it take damage.
Moves define the TACTICAL OPTIONS – what it can actually do in practice.
Both are necessary to understand a Pokémon.
================================================================================
SLIDE 9: ANOMALY DETECTION (40 seconds)
For anomaly detection, I used Isolation Forest with a contamination of 5%.
The plot shows the outliers in red in PCA space. We can see that they are often located on the periphery of the clusters.
I detected around 50 to 60 outlier Pokémon, which is about 5% of the dataset.
Why are they anomalous? Several reasons:
Either one stat is extremely high or low
Or the total stats are exceptional
Or it is an unusual combination of stats
Or an extreme specialization





================================================================================
SLIDE 10: LEGENDARIES VS NORMAL POKÉMON (50 seconds)
And now, a major discovery.
Legendaries are FIVE TIMES more likely to be outliers than normal Pokémon!
Look at the numbers: 15 to 25% of legendaries are outliers, compared to only 3 to 5% of normal Pokémon.
What does that mean?
It means that the intentional design of the developers is mathematically visible in the data. Legendaries are created to be exceptional, unique, powerful. They are not subject to the same balancing constraints as ordinary Pokémon.
This is a quantitative validation of something all players know intuitively: legendaries are different.
================================================================================
SLIDE 11: CONCLUSION (40 seconds)
To conclude, five main findings:
One – Five archetypes naturally emerge from the statistics
Two – These clusters reveal combat roles, not elemental types
Three – Text mining captures mechanics beyond official categories
Four – Stats and moves are complementary: potential versus options
Five – Legendaries are mathematically different by design
The overall insight is that unsupervised learning can reveal the hidden structure of game design. The developers’ choices, which are often implicit, become visible and quantifiable through data.
================================================================================
SLIDE 12: LIMITATIONS AND EXTENSIONS (30 seconds)
A few limitations of the approach.
K-Means forces each Pokémon into a single cluster; there is no fuzziness. PCA loses 40% of the variance. And the text analysis is limited by the quality of the descriptions.
In terms of possible extensions, we could do a temporal analysis across generations, network analysis, supervised learning to predict competitive tiers, or even a team recommendation system.

That’s it, thank you for your attention. I’m ready to answer your questions.

Total duration: approximately 6–7 minutes
PRESENTATION TIPS:
Speak at a natural pace, not too fast
Pause after important points
Point to the charts when you mention them
Look at the audience, not only at the slides
Be enthusiastic – it’s a cool project!
If you go over 7 minutes, you can shorten slides 3, 7, or 12
ANSWERS TO POTENTIAL QUESTIONS:
Q: Why K-Means and not DBSCAN?
A: DBSCAN requires tuning epsilon and min_samples, and there is no clear notion of “noise” in Pokémon stats. K-Means is more suitable here.
Q: Why PCA and not t-SNE or UMAP?
A: PCA is deterministic, fast, and interpretable. t-SNE and UMAP are good for visualization but less suitable for quantitative interpretation.
Q: How do you handle the fact that the data is imbalanced?
A: For unsupervised clustering, imbalance is not a major issue. K-Means simply minimizes inertia; it does not try to predict classes.
Q: What does this add compared to manual analysis?
A: It reveals patterns that are not intuitively obvious. For example, that clusters do not correspond to types, or that legendaries are 5× more likely to be outliers.
