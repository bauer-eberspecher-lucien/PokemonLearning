Exploring Pokémon Data with Unsupervised Learning



SLIDE 1: TITLE PAGE (10 seconds)
Hello everyone. Today we are going to present our project on exploring Pokémon data using unsupervised learning techniques.
================================================================================
SLIDE 2: OVERVIEW (30 seconds)
The objective of this project is to discover hidden patterns in Pokémon data.
We worked with three datasets:
– Around one thousand Pokémon with their base statistics such as HP, attack, and defense
– Around nine hundred moves with their textual descriptions
– A dataset linking Pokémon to the moves they can learn
The main question is: do Pokémon naturally group themselves according to their characteristics, and do these groups correspond to the official Pokémon types?
================================================================================
SLIDE 3: UNDERSTANDING THE DATA (25 seconds)
First, a brief exploratory data analysis.
Some missing values are semantically normal: for example, Pokémon with only one type, or status moves with no power. These were handled appropriately.
We also observe that the data is imbalanced, with Water, Normal, and Grass types being overrepresented, which likely reflects game design choices.
================================================================================
SLIDE 4: CLUSTERING – METHODOLOGY (35 seconds)
For clustering, the data was normalized using StandardScaler.
We chose K-Means because Pokémon have well-defined statistical profiles, such as attackers or defenders.
The number of clusters was selected using the elbow method and the silhouette score, leading to k equal to five.
The silhouette score is around 0.35 to 0.40, which is reasonable for real-world data.
For visualization, we used PCA, which explains about 60% of the variance with two components.
================================================================================
SLIDE 5: THE 5 ARCHETYPES (40 seconds)
The clustering reveals five clear archetypes:
– Fast Sweepers, with high attack and speed
– Defensive Walls, with strong physical and special defenses
– Special Attackers, focused on special attack
– Bulky Pokémon, with high HP
– Balanced Pokémon, with evenly distributed stats
Even in two dimensions, the clusters are relatively well separated in PCA space.
================================================================================





SLIDE 6: MAIN INSIGHT (55 seconds)
The most important result is that these clusters do not correspond to the official Pokémon types.
Types define elemental strengths and weaknesses, following a rock-paper-scissors logic.
The clusters, however, define combat roles — how a Pokémon is played.
For example, a Water-type Pokémon can belong to any cluster depending on its stats: it can be a fast sweeper, a defensive wall, or a bulky Pokémon.
In short, types define what a Pokémon is strong against, while clusters define how it plays.
================================================================================
SLIDE 7: TEXT ANALYSIS (35 seconds)
We also analyzed move descriptions using TF-IDF.
Different categories show distinct vocabularies:
– Physical moves emphasize damage and power
– Special moves focus on special effects and stats
– Status moves emphasize effects, stages, and stat changes
Beyond official categories, we identify subgroups such as healing moves, defensive moves, and stat-modifying moves.
The text captures the mechanics of moves, not just their damage type.
================================================================================
SLIDE 8: STATS VS MOVES (30 seconds)
We then compared Pokémon similarity based on stats versus similarity based on learnable moves.
The result shows a moderate correlation.
Stats describe a Pokémon’s potential, while moves describe its tactical options.
Both perspectives are complementary and necessary for a complete understanding.
================================================================================
SLIDE 9: ANOMALY DETECTION (30 seconds)
For anomaly detection, we used Isolation Forest with a contamination of 5%.
About 50 to 60 Pokémon are detected as outliers, often located at the edges of clusters.
They usually have extreme stats, unusual combinations, or very strong specialization.






================================================================================
SLIDE 10: LEGENDARIES VS NORMAL POKÉMON (40 seconds)
A key result concerns legendary Pokémon.
They are about five times more likely to be outliers than normal Pokémon.
Around 15 to 25% of legendaries are anomalies, compared to only 3 to 5% of regular Pokémon.
This shows that the developers’ intention to make legendaries exceptional is clearly visible in the data.
================================================================================
SLIDE 11: CONCLUSION (35 seconds)
To conclude:
– Five archetypes naturally emerge from Pokémon statistics
– These clusters represent combat roles, not elemental types
– Text analysis reveals move mechanics beyond official categories
– Stats and moves provide complementary information
– Legendary Pokémon are mathematically distinct by design
Unsupervised learning makes implicit game design choices visible and quantifiable.
================================================================================
SLIDE 12: LIMITATIONS AND EXTENSIONS (25 seconds)
Some limitations include the rigidity of K-Means, information loss with PCA, and reliance on text quality.
Possible extensions include analysis across generations, network analysis, supervised learning for competitive tiers, or team recommendation systems.
